## Store information for tabs and buffers(and windows)
[x] - add buffer, tab and window info on BufReadPost to buffer_list
[x] - remove buffer info on BufLeave

## Quick navigation between open buffers by using assigned keystrokes.
[x] - Assign keystrokes to buffers on BufReadPost
[x] - Have a quick navigation window/list that shows names and keystroke
[x] - Open bufs on keystrokes
[] - Make window non-modifiable, and disable all other keystrokes apart from exit
[] - Close window on exits

## User Experience
[x] - Setting up highlighting colors for texts and floating window layout
[] - Custom configurations of opts
[] - Only show paths for buffers have similar names
[x] - Even out the displays for buffer numbers
[] - Make shortcut keys replaceable with user defined options
[] - Disregard Uppercase letters if desired

## Developer Experience
[x] - Organize the codebase into manageable modules

## Navigate open buffers appropriately based on where they were initially opened
[] - handle opening new buffers in preferred tabs based on cwd
[] - Update list of buffers and tables if moved from one to another

## Edge Cases
[] - What happens when the last buffer/window/tab is closed?
[] - Query which tab to use on opening a new buffer?
